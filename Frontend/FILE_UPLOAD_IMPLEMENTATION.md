# File Upload Implementation for Composite Actions

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Interface and State**
- Modified `NewEventForm` interface to support both file upload and Google Sheets links
- Added new fields:
  - `attendants_file: File | null` - for uploaded files
  - `attendants_source: "link" | "file" | null` - user's choice between link/file
  - `attendants_validated: boolean` - unified validation status
  - Replaced popup-related fields with `validation_error` and `validating`

### 2. **Enhanced Validation Function**
- Created unified `handleValidation()` function that supports both file and link validation
- Validates file types (CSV, Excel) and size (max 5MB)
- Properly sends ISO-formatted start_date and end_date to validation endpoint
- Sends FormData to `POST /validate/sheet` with either `url` or `file` parameter
- Comprehensive error handling for different HTTP status codes:
  - **422**: Formats validation error arrays with field locations and messages
  - **400**: Handles structured error/details format
  - **200**: Success with no content
- Improved error display with proper React-safe string formatting

### 3. **Updated FormData Creation & Event Submission**
- Modified `createCompositeFormData()` to conditionally include either:
  - `members link` field (when using Google Sheets)
  - `members_file` field (when uploading file)
- Enhanced logging to show file information
- Fixed event submission to use ISO-formatted dates (start_date, end_date)

### 4. **Redesigned Step 4 UI**
- Replaced popup modal with inline form
- Added radio button selection between "Google Sheets Link" and "Upload File"
- Dynamic forms that show appropriate inputs based on user choice
- Real-time validation with clear status indicators
- Comprehensive error display with proper formatting

### 5. **Updated Navigation Logic**
- Changed all validation checks from `attendants_link_validated` to `attendants_validated`
- Updated submit button conditions to use unified validation state

### 6. **Enhanced Summary Display**
- Updated event summary to show appropriate information for both link and file sources
- Shows file name when file is uploaded
